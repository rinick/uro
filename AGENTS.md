## Coding Guidelines

- Prefer simple, minimal code. Avoid unnecessary abstractions, indirection, or large rewrites when a smaller change is enough.
- If you hit an error, blocker, or unclear requirement, stop and ask for clarification before continuing.
- When refactoring or redesigning code, fully clean up old logic that no longer applies. Do not leave obsolete branches, unused variables, stale comments, or dead code.
- Keep names aligned with the current feature behavior. Update variable names, function names, translation keys, and related comments when the feature meaning changes.
- When adding or changing strings in i18n.ts, update the translations for all supported languages in the same change.

## Project Shape

- This is a pnpm workspace monorepo for Ulugo, a Go/Weiqi SGF editor.
- `apps/web` is the React + Vite UI. It uses Ant Design in compact mode and should prefer small Antd components.
- `apps/electron` wraps the same web UI for desktop and owns Electron-only KataGo integration.
- `packages/sgf-core` owns SGF document parsing, editing, and serialization behavior.
- `packages/go-core` owns Go board position derivation and rules-related board state.
- `packages/react-shudan` is the local React TypeScript fork of Shudan used for board rendering.
- `packages/analysis-core`, `packages/katago-core`, and `packages/sgf-analysis-tree` hold shared analysis, KataGo settings/types, and tree helpers.

## UI Conventions

- Reuse the same React UI for web and Electron. Show or hide platform-specific controls with capability flags instead of creating separate UI implementations.
- Keep the board as large as possible. Avoid responsive relayout that moves side panels below the board.
- IndexedDB open/save controls are web-only. Electron uses file import/export and KataGo/analysis controls.
- Localization lives in `apps/web/src/features/localization/i18n.ts`; keep locale keys aligned across all languages.

## KataGo And Analysis

- KataGo process management and downloads are Electron-only.
- Analysis data should be cached by SGF node id so fast/live analysis does not recalculate unchanged nodes unnecessarily.
- Fast analysis should cover existing SGF moves and continue working as new moves are added.
- Board analysis display should follow KaTrain/Sabaki behavior where practical, while using the Ulugo/Shudan rendering path.

## Commands

- Web typecheck: `pnpm --filter @ulugo/web typecheck`
- Web build: `pnpm --filter @ulugo/web build`
- Electron dev: `pnpm dev:electron`
- Full typecheck: `pnpm typecheck`
